# Folder Structure
    - package.json
        - File with all dependency packages
    - src folder
        - Contains all source code file for following
            - Compoents
            - Services
            - Models
            - Utilities
    - public folder
        - The Production Files
            - index.html, the DOM that will be mounted in browser
# React.js Object Models
    - Component
        - Autonomous Object that contains
            - User Interface with Compiled JSX
            - State Properties to Bind Data with UI Elements
            - Methods, those are executed when events are raised on UI Elements
        - Component Types
            - The 'Class Component', a Traditional ES 6 approach for Creating React Component that is derived from Component<P,S> base class
                - This contains Lifecycle Methods for effectively managing the Component execution once it is Mounted on UI THread
                    - constructor()
                        - Contains State Properties declaration using the 'state' object with initial Values
                    - shouldComponentUpdate()    
                        - Check if the state is changed so that component can be updated 
                    - componentWillUpdate()
                        - If the shouldComponentUpdate() retuirns treue then new Vitrual DOM is created
                    render()
                        - Mount the UI on Browser UI Thread    
                    - componentDidCatch()
                        - Method to render a fallback view when the child compoennt crash    
                    - componentDidMount()
                        - Executed after the render() completes its execution and this contains resource-intensice code e.g. Ajax calls
                        - This may resule in component's properties update and agsin calls
                            - shouldComponentUpdate()
                            - componentWillUpdate()
                            - render()
            - The 'Functional Component', from React 16+ (Recommended)
                - A JavaScript Function that returns the DOM
                - No Lifecycle method explicitly available
                - No explicit declation of the 'state' object for declaring state properties                    
                - The React 16.8+ use 'React Hooks' for State, Lifecycle, Data Communication across components, State updates, etc.
                    - useState()
                        - Declare and Update State with fix type
                    - useEffect()
                        - Manage resource intensive operations and State updates
                    - useContext()
                        - Share data across components
                    - useReducer()
                        - State update with 'State Transition'
                        - From Initial to Final Value when the type of final value is not known
                    - useRef()
                        - Reference for DOM
                    - ... and many more
                - Hooks are JavaScript functions with predefined behavior taht is configured for React Functional components    

    - react
        - provides 'React' class
        - Following Types
            - Component<P,S>
                - The base class for all components
                - The 'P' is props
                - The 'S' is state
            - PureComponent
                - A Specially defined Component base class to Performance improvisation   
                    - does not innoke the shouldComponentUpdate() method              
    - react-dom
        - Provides 'ReactDOM' class  
            - Used to Mount the DOM from Component on UI Thread

# React.js Core Concepts
- Statefull Component
    - A Component that has a local mutable values those are scopped within the Component itself
        - They are defined as 'State Properties' using 'useState' Hook
        - When the component is unmounted the state property will also be killed or released
    - A Component that accepts immutable values from its parent component
        - They are passed to child from parent using 'props' object  
        - The 'props' object is a JavaScript literal which contains Key:Value pairs for the data that is received from parent to child component also emitted from child to parent    
        - The 'props' data will be available till the parent component is live
    - The 'useState(initialState, Dispatch<SetStateAction>)'
        - Used to define a State Property (aka Object) with 'initialState' and 'State Update Callback Function' that will be dispated using 'Dispatch<SetStateAction>' object
        - TO update the state, the state property MUST be bound with UI element of which event will be responsible to Dispatch the action that execute 'State Uopdate Callback function' to update the state property from intital to final      
            - e.g.
                const [x,setX] = useState(0);
                    - x is state property
                    - setX() is a callbak function will be dispatched to update 'x'
    - Component Creation Practices
        - Make sure that if the UI is repetating across same component as well as the same UI is required across multiple component then consider creating a reusable component
            - Increase Reusability of the Component(s) by distributing them across various container/parent component (Composable UI)
                - Plan for the UI requirements of the Reusable Component
                - Carefully declare state properties for the component OR plan for what data this component will accept from its parent using 'props'
                    - a property that will be used to generate HTML UI dynamically for child component 
                    -  a property  that will be responsible for handing 'One-way' data flow from parent to child component (Optional)
                        - This will be mandatory if the custom component is used for data binding and data updates from parent to child component and child to parent 
                - Plan on the events that will be responsible for emitting data from this child component to its parent
                    - Raise an event in child and let the parent subscribe to it 
                    - This event subscription will be implemented using 'props' 
            - IMP**
                - Make sure that each property received by the ReUsable component is validated, this will pevent the component crashing      
        - Using 'Context'
            - props are passed manually from parent to child and thet are scopped to child but since props is live throught the UI Thread, these properties are alos avalilable
            - Instead the 'React.Context' is better approach to manage the data 'globally' and it is possible to make that data available only for the component who wants to use it
            - const Context = React.createContext();
                - CReate a Context
            - Context.Provider, this is 'value' property to create key:value pair for the data to be provider to children componants.
                - The 'value' is 'complex-json' object  
                    - {}, {{}}, {{{}}} 
            - Context.Consumer, the 'useContext' Hook is used by child component to sunscribe to Context and read data stored in 'value' property                        
        - Instead of declaring separate state properties consider defining a ES class with public proeprties in it and define a state using this class instance. You can also create a JSON object for the same                 
    - Performing AJAX Calls
        - USe Promise based library
            - npm install --save axios
        - This package has 'axios' object that contains following methods
            - get(url, AxiosRequestConfig):Promise<R>
            - post(url,data,AxiosRequestConfig):Promise<R>
            - put(url,data,AxiosRequestConfig):Promise<R>
            - delete(url,AxiosRequestConfig):Promise<R>
        - AxiosRequestConfig
            - The Object that contais or defines Request Configration to external Services                 
                - headers
                    - Header Info e.g.
                        - content-type
                        - authorization
                        - version
                        - custom-headers
        - data
            - The data to be posted (create news) or put (update existing) towards the REST API       
            - mostly this is JSON data    
        - HTTP 2
            - Text, Xml, Json, BLOB, ArrayBuffer          
- Lifecycle
    - initialRender Of class component is execution for functional component
    - propsChange of class component is propsChange same for functional component
    - stateChanges of class component is 'useState() plues event dispatch()' for functional component            
    - render() of class component is return() for functional component
    - componentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount() of class component are combined in 'useEffect()' hook of functional component
        - useEffect(()=>{
            logic for componentDidMount

            return(()=>{
                logic that will be executed for componentWillUnMount
            })
        });
