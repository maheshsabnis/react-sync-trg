    - src folder
        - Contains all source code file for following
            - Compoents
            - Services
            - Models
            - Utilities
    - public folder
        - The Production Files
            - index.html, the DOM that will be mounted in browser
# React.js Object Models
    - Component
        - Autonomous Object that contains
            - User Interface with Compiled JSX
            - State Properties to Bind Data with UI Elements
            - Methods, those are executed when events are raised on UI Elements
        - Component Types
            - The 'Class Component', a Traditional ES 6 approach for Creating React Component that is derived from Component<P,S> base class
                - This contains Lifecycle Methods for effectively managing the Component execution once it is Mounted on UI THread
                    - constructor()
                        - Contains State Properties declaration using the 'state' object with initial Values
                    - shouldComponentUpdate()    
                        - Check if the state is changed so that component can be updated 
                    - componentWillUpdate()
                        - If the shouldComponentUpdate() retuirns treue then new Vitrual DOM is created
                    render()
                        - Mount the UI on Browser UI Thread    
                    - componentDidCatch()
                        - Method to render a fallback view when the child compoennt crash    
                    - componentDidMount()
                        - Executed after the render() completes its execution and this contains resource-intensice code e.g. Ajax calls
                        - This may resule in component's properties update and agsin calls
                            - shouldComponentUpdate()
                            - componentWillUpdate()
                            - render()
            - The 'Functional Component', from React 16+ (Recommended)
                - A JavaScript Function that returns the DOM
                - No Lifecycle method explicitly available
                - No explicit declation of the 'state' object for declaring state properties                    
                - The React 16.8+ use 'React Hooks' for State, Lifecycle, Data Communication across components, State updates, etc.
                    - useState()
                        - Declare and Update State with fix type
                    - useEffect()
                        - Manage resource intensive operations and State updates
                    - useContext()
                        - Share data across components
                    - useReducer()
                        - State update with 'State Transition'
                        - From Initial to Final Value when the type of final value is not known
                    - useRef()
                        - Reference for DOM
                    - ... and many more
                - Hooks are JavaScript functions with predefined behavior taht is configured for React Functional components    

    - react
        - provides 'React' class
        - Following Types
            - Component<P,S>
                - The base class for all components
                - The 'P' is props
                - The 'S' is state
            - PureComponent
                - A Specially defined Component base class to Performance improvisation

    - react-dom
        - Provides 'ReactDOM' class  
            - Used to Mount the DOM from Component on UI Thread

# React.js Core Concepts
- Statefull Component
    - A Component that has a local mutable values those are scopped within the Component itself
        - They are defined as 'State Properties' using 'useState' Hook
        - When the component is unmounted the state property will also be killed or released
    - A Component that accepts immutable values from its parent component
        - They are passed to child from parent using 'props' object  
        - The 'props' object is a JavaScript literal which contains Key:Value pairs for the data that is received from parent to child component also emitted from child to parent    
        - The 'props' data will be available till the parent component is live
    - The 'useState(initialState, Dispatch<SetStateAction>)'
        - Used to define a State Property (aka Object) with 'initialState' and 'State Update Callback Function' that will be dispated using 'Dispatch<SetStateAction>' object
        - TO update the state, the state property MUST be bound with UI element of which event will be responsible to Dispatch the action that execute 'State Uopdate Callback function' to update the state property from intital to final      
            - e.g.
                const [x,setX] = useState(0);
                    - x is state property
                    - setX() is a callbak function will be dispatched to update 'x'
    - Component Creation Practices
        - Make sure that if the UI is repetating across same component as well as the same UI is required across multiple component then consider creating a reusable component
            - Increase Reusability of the Component(s) by distributing them across various container/parent component (Composable UI)
                - Plan for the UI requirements of the Reusable Component
                - Carefully declare state properties for the component OR plan for what data this component will accept from its parent using 'props'
                    - a property that will be used to generate HTML UI dynamically for child component 
                    -  a property  that will be responsible for handing 'One-way' data flow from parent to child component (Optional)
                        - This will be mandatory if the custom component is used for data binding and data updates from parent to child component and child to parent 
                - Plan on the events that will be responsible for emitting data from this child component to its parent
                    - Raise an event in child and let the parent subscribe to it 
                    - This event subscription will be implemented using 'props' 
            - IMP**
                - Make sure that each property received by the ReUsable component is validated, this will pevent the component crashing      
        - Using 'Context'
            - props are passed manually from parent to child and thet are scopped to child but since props is live throught the UI Thread, these properties are alos avalilable
            - Instead the 'React.Context' is better approach to manage the data 'globally' and it is possible to make that data available only for the component who wants to use it
            - const Context = React.createContext();
                - CReate a Context
            - Context.Provider, this is 'value' property to create key:value pair for the data to be provider to children componants.
                - The 'value' is 'complex-json' object  
                    - {}, {{}}, {{{}}} 
            - Context.Consumer, the 'useContext' Hook is used by child component to sunscribe to Context and read data stored in 'value' property                        
        - Instead of declaring separate state properties consider defining a ES class with public proeprties in it and define a state using this class instance. You can also create a JSON object for the same                 
    - Performing AJAX Calls
        - USe Promise based library
            - npm install --save axios
        - This package has 'axios' object that contains following methods
            - get(url, AxiosRequestConfig):Promise<R>
            - post(url,data,AxiosRequestConfig):Promise<R>
            - put(url,data,AxiosRequestConfig):Promise<R>
            - delete(url,AxiosRequestConfig):Promise<R>
        - AxiosRequestConfig
            - The Object that contais or defines Request Configration to external Services                 
                - headers
                    - Header Info e.g.
                        - content-type
                        - authorization
                        - version
                        - custom-headers
        - data
            - The data to be posted (create news) or put (update existing) towards the REST API       
            - mostly this is JSON data    
        - HTTP 2
            - Text, Xml, Json, BLOB, ArrayBuffer          
- Lifecycle
    - initialRender Of class component is execution for functional component
    - propsChange of class component is propsChange same for functional component
    - stateChanges of class component is 'useState() plues event dispatch()' for functional component            
    - render() of class component is return() for functional component
    - componentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount() of class component are combined in 'useEffect()' hook of functional component
        - useEffect(()=>{
            logic for componentDidMount

            return(()=>{
                logic that will be executed for componentWillUnMount
            })
        });
        - useEffect(effect: EffectCallback, deps?: DependencyList)
            - EffectCallback
                - Callback function that has following 2 responsibilities
                    - EffectCallback = () => (void | Destructor)
                        - This is a TuypeScript Uniion Types, this means a variable can be declared using multiple types
                            - The 'void' is the function that doe not return any value
                                - This function will continue execution
                                - For the First Execution of theis function function, the state will be updated and rendering will be executed on DOM
                                - Since the render will continue for each state update, we have to make sure that the useEffet() stop its execution after the first execution and its coresponding state update
                                - USe the DependencyList for stopping an execution of useEffct()
                            - The Destructor, means that the function will be returning an object that will release all resources 
                                - USe this to release or destroy any HTTP handler object
                                - Use this to release or unsubscribe any event that is registered for the current component
                        -  DependencyList
                            - It is a readonly array that contains list of all state properties for current component and its update dispatches
                            - THis will make sure that the uesEffect() will stop when the state is updated and DOM is rendered with state udpates     
- Error Boundaries
    -  Create a Application Level Component that act as a Parent Component for all other children component to listen and handle errors raise on any of the child component 
    - This can be possible only by using 'Class COmponents'
        - implement 'componentDidCatch(error, log)' funciton to listen to catch
            - error : actual error 
            - log: used to generate statckTrace in browser
        - implement the 'getDerivedStateFromError(error)' a static property that will update the state of the ErrorCoundary compoenent and will help in printing the error message
- Portal
- Creating Custom Hooks
    - The React Hooks can be executed only at Functional Component level
    - We cannot call them/ use them inside other function, except the custom hook is not created
- Single Page App
    - React ROuter DOM
        - 'Client-Side-Routing'
            - Manages navigation across all components w/o making a new request to laod the component
            - Instead, the component is loaded from Client
            - This improves the Rendering speed, this does not need re-evaluation of JavaScript and CSS
        - React Router DOM V6
            - 6.2 / 6.4
                - SUpport for Hooks from V6
            - Routes
                - Acts as a colleciton of Route
            - Route
                - An Expression that has following properties
                    - path, the URL
                    - element, the Component's DOM Name
                    - index, the landing page
            - Link
                - a Mechanism to query to Routes
                - 'to', accepts the URL for query
            - Outlet
                - The container to render Components as DOM Element
            - useNavigate
                - Naigate across Components using URL 
            - useParams
                - responsible to read route parameters    
            - BrowserRouter
                - COnatier for the React-Router-DOM with following responsibilities
                    - Manage the Routes, a collection of routes
                        - path and element for React Component navigation
                    - Query to the route collection using the link that accepts the 'path' as input
                    - Search the component and mount  it in 'outlet'                   
- useReducer
    - This hook is responsible to perform state updates based in state transition
        - Initial State, Success State , Failure State
    - Use useReducer() hook instead of useState() when the state property is having an external dependency for value updates
    - Syntax
        - useReducer(reducer, intialState)
            - reducer 
                - a JS Pure Function that accepts following parameters
                    - Parameters 1: the 'state', the object thatb is to be changed
                    - Parameter 2: the 'action', the action that is dispatched that cause the state to be changed
                        - This is a complex object that has following properties
                            - type: the action that is dispatched
                            - payload: the result of the action which is dispatched. This payload is the new value that is mutated (aka updated) in the state object 
                - The reducer function MUST not have any alogic, instead it MUST work for state transitons             
            -  intialState, a complex object that is initial value, state transition, final value, and the error value              
```` javascript
function useReducer<R extends Reducer<any, any>>(
        reducer: R,
        initialState: ReducerState<R>,
        initializer?: undefined
    ): [ReducerState<R>, Dispatch<ReducerAction<R>>];

````

    - reducer: reducer function
    - initialState: the initial state which will be updated
    - ReducerState: the state object that will be updated in transitions based on dispatch
    - Dispatch: An action that will be executed based on either user intraction or any-other resource intensive execution e.g. Ajax calls with Promise object  
        - ReducerAction: The action type that will decide the payload data that will be updated in the state object

- Split the UI and Logic of the Front-End App across
    - Various Reusable Components
    - Various JS Classes contating utility logic
    - The LazyLoading 
        -  Used if the Child component has resource intensive operations under execution and that may delay the rendering time of the child component
        - The LAzy Loading will be sued by parent to create a fallback UI for such delyed components
        - The 'Suspense' component container in 'react' library
            - the 'facllback' proeprty of the Suspense will have the fallback UI loaded in parent till the actual component is not loaded
        - React.lazy(), a method that is used to lazy load the component
            - This is generally used when third-party components are needed by your application    
    - The Code-Splitting      
        - This is used when there are several JS Modules are loaded in browser
        - THis is used to load the JS module asynchronously
        - import("MODULE_FILE_PATH").then(SUCCESS).catch(error)     
- Redux     
    - Concepts
        - State Management
            - store: a global/application state container
            - action: an object that will be responsible to dispatch an event request from UI
                - The action may have an input pareameter
                - The action will have an output paraneter as object
                    - { type: OUTPUT_ACTION, payload:THE_OUTPUT_STATE }
                - asction may be synchropnous or async     
            - reducer: a pure function that listen to each action and acordingly update the stote with new state
                - this function has tow parameters
                    - state: Initial State /  previous state / old state
                    - action: the action output object
                        - { type: OUTPUT_ACTION, payload:THE_OUTPUT_STATE }
                        - based on OUTPUT_ACTION the store will be updated with THE_OUTPUT_STATE
                - one reducer function can call other reducer function
                - the reducer function MUST not have complex or time-consuming logic        
    - Packages
        - redux
            - createStore(), a method tat is used to create a store
                - createStore(reducer, enhancer);
                    - reducer is reducer function
                    - enhancer, is an obejct that will simulate the execution  of reduct in browser (NOT RECOMMENDED IN PRODUCTION)
            - combineReducers(), a method that will combine all reducer functions into a single reducer function
                - const reduecers = combineReducers({reducerfn1, reducerfn2,...});
        - react-redux
            - The 'Provider' is a container component that will connect the react with redux
                - The provider will load the store at application level so that all components can access it
            - useDispatch()
                - A hook that is used to dispatch an action from UI (component)
            - useSelector()
                - A Hook that is used to subscribe to store so that data from the store can be queried and made available to UI (Component)
